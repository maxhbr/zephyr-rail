Some adapters and parts are 3D rintent. See [[./3d-print.scad]].

** Electronics
*** Optocopplers to drive the stepper motor
*** IR LED driver
The Camera is controlled via IR. The IR LED is driven by a transistor.

** Controller
MCU:
- [[STM32H747I-DISCO][https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32h747i-disco.html]]
- [[B-U585I-IOT02A][https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-u585i-iot02a.html]] with Adafruit 2.4" TFT
- ~~[[WIO Terminal][https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-p-4509.html]]~~ only the first three gpio-keys work and [[PWM is not clear][https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/issues/66547]]

The firmware is written with zephyr. The code is in [[./src]] and the project root is [[./]].
